# Kucoin-Futures-With-Finta-RSI

The algorithm demonstrates a solid foundation for automated trading strategies based on technical analysis indicators. Kucoin Futures trading algorithm meant to execute LONG and SHORT order for Cryptocurrency Futures Market using RSI Threshold and RSI Divergency while dynamically setting SL and TP using BBands

#### Overview
Utilizes asyncio for concurrency, integrates technical analysis indicators from the Finta library, and interacts with the exchange via the CCXT library. The primary strategy involves trading based on RSI (Relative Strength Index) and Bollinger Bands signals.

#### Code Structure and Components
The code is structured into several components:

1. **Global Variables and Configuration**: 
   - Environment variables (`API_KEY`, `SECRET_KEY`, `PASSPHRASE`) are loaded using `dotenv`.
   - Global constants define trading parameters such as `SYMBOL`, `TIMEFRAME`, `SLEEP_INTERVAL`, `MAX_RETRIES`, and `RETRY_DELAY`.

2. **CryptoTrader Class**:
   - **Initialization (`initialize` method)**: Sets up the KuCoin Futures exchange instance and the `CCXTTrade` instance for executing trades.
   - **Data Fetching and Analysis (`fetch_and_analyze_ohlcv` method)**:
     - Fetches historical OHLCV data for a specified symbol and timeframe.
     - Converts data into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
     - Calculates RSI and Bollinger Bands using the Finta library.
     - Generates trading signals (`signal_rsi_threshold` and `signal_rsi_divergence`) based on RSI conditions and refined RSI divergence strategy.
     - Executes trades using `execute_trade` if signals indicate a `LONG` or `SHORT` position.
   - **Signal Generation and Execution (`generate_signal_rsi_threshold`, `generate_signal_rsi_divergence`, `dynamic_stop_loss_take_profit`, `execute_trade` methods)**:
     - `generate_signal_rsi_threshold` checks for RSI overbought and oversold conditions.
     - `generate_signal_rsi_divergence` detects rapid price and RSI divergences.
     - `dynamic_stop_loss_take_profit` calculates dynamic stop-loss and take-profit levels based on Bollinger Bands.
     - `execute_trade` attempts to execute market orders and associated stop-loss/take-profit orders with retry logic for reliability.

3. **Main Execution Loop (`main` function)**:
   - Initializes an instance of `CryptoTrader`, handles exceptions during initialization and trading, and restarts the trading process upon failure or interruption.
   - Ensures continuous operation of the trading bot with error handling and recovery mechanisms.

#### Assessment and Recommendations
##### Strengths:
- **Concurrency and Asynchronous Operations**: Utilizes asyncio to handle multiple operations concurrently, enhancing efficiency in data fetching and trading execution.
- **Technical Analysis Integration**: Integrates well-established technical indicators (RSI, Bollinger Bands) to generate trading signals, leveraging the Finta library for calculation accuracy.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements retry mechanisms (`MAX_RETRIES` and `RETRY_DELAY`) for resilient trade execution in case of errors.
